This Helm Chart creates an Istio RequestAuthentication Object that defines the rules for the authentication of services based on the evaluation of a JWT Token.

The JWT Token is evaluated against a Keycloak Instace and its Address is defined in the object manifest.

Issuer URL: {{ .Values.requestAuth.issuerUrl }}

Keycloak Internal Service Address: {{ .Values.requestAuth.keycloakUrl }}
